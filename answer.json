She publicly revealed their marriage in a video montage at the listening party for her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in Manhattan's Sony Club on October 22, 2008. I Am... Sasha Fierce was released on November 18, 2008 in the United States. The album formally introduces Beyonc\u00e9's alter ego Sasha Fierce, conceived during the making of her 2003 single \"Crazy in Love\", selling 482,000 copies in its first week, debuting atop the Billboard 200, and giving Beyonc\u00e9 her third consecutive number-one album in the US. The album featured the number-one song \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\" and the top-five songs \"If I Were a Boy\" and \"Halo\". Achieving the accomplishment of becoming her longest-running Hot 100 single in her career, \"Halo\"'s success in the US helped Beyonc\u00e9 attain more top-ten singles on the list than any other woman during the 2000s. It also included the successful \"Sweet Dreams\", and singles \"Diva\", \"Ego\", \"Broken-Hearted Girl\" and \"Video Phone\". The music video for \"Single Ladies\" has been parodied and imitated around the world, spawning the \"first major dance craze\" of the Internet age according to the Toronto Star. The video has won several awards, including Best Video at the 2009 MTV Europe Music Awards, the 2009 Scottish MOBO Awards, and the 2009 BET Awards. At the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was nominated for nine awards, ultimately winning three including Video of the Year. Its failure to win the Best Female Video category, which went to American country pop singer Taylor Swift's \"You Belong with Me\", led to Kanye West interrupting the ceremony and Beyonc\u00e9 improvising a re-presentation of Swift's award during her own acceptance speech.

The campaign, which aired on February 28, was set to her new music. A concert for the cause took place on June 1, 2013 in London and included other acts like Ellie Goulding, Florence and the Machine, and Rita Ora. In advance of the concert, she appeared in a campaign video released on 15 May 2013, where she, along with Cameron Diaz, John Legend and Kylie Minogue, described inspiration from their mothers, while a number of other artists celebrated personal inspiration from other women, leading to a call for submission of photos of women of viewers' inspiration from which a selection was shown at the concert. Beyonc\u00e9 said about her mother Tina Knowles that her gift was \"finding the best qualities in every human being.\" With help of the crowdfunding platform Catapult, visitors of the concert could choose between several projects promoting education of women and girls. Beyonc\u00e9 is also taking part in \"Miss a Meal\", a food-donation campaign, and supporting Goodwill charity through online charity auctions at Charitybuzz that support job creation throughout Europe and the U.S.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 280, "text": "Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting"}], "question": "Which national event caused Beyonce to produce \"Demand a Plan?\"", "id": "56bed5983aeaaa14008c94f3"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 412, "text": "I Was Here"}], "question": "What song did Beyonce contribute to the campaign?", "id": "56bed5983aeaaa14008c94f4"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1553, "text": "Miss a Meal"}], "question": "Beyonce is contributing to which food-donation campaign?", "id": "56bed5983aeaaa14008c94f5"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 765, "text": "London"}], "question": "On June 1 , 2013 where was the concert held for \"a Chime for Change\"?", "id": "56bed5983aeaaa14008c94f6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1277, "text": "her mother"}], "question": "Beyonce was speaking about whom when she said her gift was \"finding the best qualities in every human being.\"?", "id": "56bed5983aeaaa14008c94f7"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 280, "text": "Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting."}], "question": "The Demand a Plan video campaign followed what tragic event?", "id": "56bfed855a85de14001c7864"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 616, "text": "spread female empowerment"}], "question": "What was the focus of the Gucci Chime for Change campaign?", "id": "56bfed855a85de14001c7866"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1409, "text": "Catapult"}], "question": "What crowdfunding platform was used in the concert?", "id": "56bfed855a85de14001c7868"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 108, "text": "Demand A Plan"}], "question": "What is the name of the campaign that Beyonc\u00e9 and others are involved in that deals with gun control?", "id": "56d4fa2e2ccc5a1400d833ca"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 280, "text": "Sandy Hook Elementary School"}], "question": "What school shooting prompted the creation of Demand A Plan?", "id": "56d4fa2e2ccc5a1400d833cb"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 412, "text": "I Was Here"}], "question": "What song did Beyonc\u00e9 donate to the 2012 World Humanitarian Day campaign?", "id": "56d4fa2e2ccc5a1400d833cc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 533, "text": "Salma Hayek and Frida Giannini"}], "question": "Who did Beyonc\u00e9 work with in 2013 on the Chime for Change campaign?", "id": "56d4fa2e2ccc5a1400d833cd"}]}]}]}
